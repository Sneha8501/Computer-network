Problem statement

The Anywhere Any Time Advance Reservation system is the online ticket reserving system where the passengers can reserve the tickets for their travel, cancel the reserved ticket and they can view the status of the ticket before traveling. The reservation option enables a person to reserve a ticket in an easier and efficient manner. Once the train is available the person will be asked to enter his details and his requirements regarding the coach. After this, the reservation database is updated with the personal details, train 
name, and also the source and destination place, and a unique PNR number is generated and given as the reference number for the user. The View option allows the user to enter the PNR number and get the current details about the ticket. The software ensures the safety and security of details about the passengers, their payment details and ensures the integrity of the data being processed
